This folder contains aslo the statistics tables generated by the the tow R scripts: "Stat_sunflower_t4 _final.R"and "Stat_sunflower_timepoints.R"

scripts = contains R scripts used for processing data and calculating traits and variables (scripts/Sunflower_processing.R) and for analysis and figures (scripts/Stat_sunflower_t4 _final.R, scripts/Stat_sunflower_timepoints.R, scripts/Fig_pannels.R)
